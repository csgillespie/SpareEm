# The SparseEm package

## Background

This is the associated R package from 

> Kaufman, C., Bingham, D., Habib, S., Heitmann, K., and Frieman, J. (2011) “Efficient Emulators of Computer Experiments Using Compactly Supported Correlation Functions, With An Application to Cosmology.” Annals of Applied Statistics, 5: 2470–2492.

The code was originally developed by Dr Cari Kaufman. This is a copy of package, updated for use with R version 3 onwards.

## Installation

You can install this package via `devtools`
```
library("devtools")
install_github("csgillespie/SparseEm", sub="pkg")
```

## Help

Unfortunately the original author can no longer provide assistance and I didn't develop this package, so can only provide limited support. 

Contributions are welcome.
